# Gatito

Just a cute terminal ascii art display for people who like cats.

## Runningâš¡

Remember to activate the execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x gatito.sh
```

and

```bash
./gatito.sh
```

## Custom command

For an even smoother experience, I suggest creating a symbolic link in a custom folder that's part of your $PATH. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your ~/.bashrc file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line to the file, replacing `/my/custom/folder` with the actual path to your custom folder:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/my/custom/folder
```
3. Create the symbolic link replacing `/path/to/gatito.sh` with the path to the script and `/my/custom/folder/gatito` with your custom folder's path:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/gatito.sh /my/custom/folder/gatito
```

Now you can display the ASCII art with just:
